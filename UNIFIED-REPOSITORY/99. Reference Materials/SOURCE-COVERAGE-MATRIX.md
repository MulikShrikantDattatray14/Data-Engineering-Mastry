# Four-source coverage and deduplication matrix

This register distinguishes **source preserved** from **concept audited** and **independently mastered**. A source path found in the repository does *not* prove that its concepts were reviewed or unified.

## Inventory integrity

- Original SQL/Python Mastery: **552/552** blobs verified unchanged in staging.
- Original Journey: **192/192** blobs verified identical inside the preserved snapshot.
- Total: **744/744** source files byte-identical by Git blob hash.
- [Downloadable machine-readable path and hash inventory](SOURCE-INVENTORY.json) maps every original file to its preserved location.
- No original repository was deleted, renamed, force-pushed or overwritten.

## Source streams

| Source | What remains preserved | Consolidation state |
|---|---|---|
| Bosscoder SQL | Original foundation notes plus individual numbered SQL problem files in `1. SQL Mastery` | Existing notes linked; full four-source topic dedup **pending** |
| Bosscoder Python | Seven lecture note/audit groups and assignment records inside preserved Journey snapshot | Seven lectures preserved; subject-specific concept audit **pending** |
| PNP SQL | Original question bank and source materials (PDF, solutions, datasets) | Source preserved; individual question mapping to canonical topics **pending** |
| PNP Python mentorship | [Original 80-page PDF](../../../2.%20Python%20Mastry/Source/1793477658005.pdf) and all 76 source-aligned lesson entries | 80-page source preserved; page-by-page consolidation **pending** |
| W3Schools SQL/Python | [Official SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) and [official Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) URLs; 36 Python topical references already in original lesson indexes | Official landing pages checked; detailed topic checks **ongoing** |
| ChatGPT Study Mode | Full independent attempt/evidence history in preserved Journey snapshot | Lessons 1–12 summarized, next Lesson 13A; new insights linked, no copied transcripts in canonical notes |

## Python source coverage index

| Section | Original PDF pages | Reference status | Canonical note |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Introduction / dataset | 1–4 | Preserved | Python basics; deeper audit pending |
| Python from Zero | 5–24 | 20 lesson files preserved | Introductory notes through tuples plus dictionaries/functions/files preview; remaining page-by-page audit pending |
| Python Foundations | 25–34 | 10 lesson files preserved | Consolidation pending |
| Advanced Python | 35–40 | 6 lesson files preserved | Consolidation pending |
| DSA and Complexity | 41–57 | 17 lesson files preserved | Consolidation pending |
| Coding Round Patterns | 58–68 | 11 lesson files preserved | Consolidation pending |
| Python for Data Engineering | 69–74 | 6 lesson files preserved | Consolidation pending |
| Practice and Revision | 75–80 | 6 lesson files preserved | Preserve distinct independent questions; consolidation pending |

## Rules for every topic

1. Read Bosscoder, PNP, official W3Schools topic and genuine Study Mode learning evidence.
2. Record **all distinct subtopics** and map each to its source section/page or problem ID.
3. Keep **one** canonical foundation explanation, adding only unique details; use a real-world scenario, short Python/SQL example, progressive values or visuals, JS analogy when helpful, and revision notes.
4. Store source problems individually in the existing detailed Bosscoder SQL format; preserve learner first attempts verbatim and official answers only if supplied/redistributable.
5. Mark `taught`, `reviewed`, `source-verified`, and `mastered` separately. Never infer mastery from moving files.
6. Do not delete original PDFs, datasets, lecture notes, question files or previous repositories.
7. Validate example outputs, Markdown links, SVG assets and source mapping before publishing to the final repository.

**Migration stage:** source integrity verified (744/744) and additional Python dictionaries, functions, modules/files and SQL joins foundation notes added. The remaining source-by-source consolidation, new repo creation and dashboard cutover are **not complete**. Specific W3Schools dictionaries, file handling and SQL joins pages were verified from the official site on November 8, 2026.
